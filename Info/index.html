        <h2>Default Values and Range -</h2>
        <p>The code is set to generate passwords between 3 and 100 characters.</p>
        <p>If you were to input a number outside that range, it will default to the closest in-range value.</p>
        <p>If you don't input a number, the code will use the default value of 20 Characters.</p>
    </div>

        <h2>Recommendations</h2>
        <p>This generator is designed with a Password manager in mind.</p>
        <p>If you don't already have a password manager, I'd recommend to get one.</p>
        <p>A Good, Free Password manager is Bitwarden.</p>
        <p>If you're viewing this on a vertical device, i recommend to keep the length under 50 characters.</p>
