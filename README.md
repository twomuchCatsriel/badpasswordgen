This is a stupid project that I started during a recess at school, which is why it was posted to my School account.
While the code was pretty simple, i'm still thinking of more ways to improve this project, to make it actually useful.
This is the first website that has actually been functional, and that i've had alot of fun making.

Is this the best or the safest password generator in the world? No, absolutely not. 
But, It's still far better than any hand generated passwords, I'd say anyways.

Anyways, I have no idea how to use github so I hope this document will entail.
